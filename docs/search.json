    "text": "In this master thesis, a data-driven modeling technique is proposed. It enables making predictions for general dynamic systems for unknown model parameter values or operating conditions. The tool is denoted as CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling. The most recent developed version delivered promising results for the chaotic Lorenz system (Lorenz 1963). Since, the earlier work was restricted to the application of only one dynamical system, with this contribution the first major improvement was to allow CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling to be utilized for any general dynamical system. For this, CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling was written from scratch in a modular manner. The limitation of the number of the dimension and the shape of the trajectory of the dynamical systems are removed. Adding a new dynamic system was designed such that it should be as straightforward as possible. To affirm this point, 10 dynamic systems, most of which are chaotic systems, are included by default. To be able to run CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling on arbitrary dynamic systems in an automated way, a parameter study for the modal decomposition method NMFNon-negative Matrix Factorization was implemented. However, since a single NMFNon-negative Matrix Factorization solution took up to hours, a second option was added, i.e., SVDSingular Value Decomposition. With SVDSingular Value Decomposition the most time-consuming task could be brought to a level of seconds. The improvements introduced, allow CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling to be executed on a general dynamic system on a normal computer in a reasonable time. Furthermore, CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling comes with its integrated post-processor in form of HTML files to inspect the generated plots in detail. All the parameters used in CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling some additional beneficial features can be controlled via one settings file.\n\n\n\n\nLorenz, Edward N. 1963. “Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow.” Journal of Atmospheric Sciences 20 (2): 130–41."

    "text": "In this work, a tool called control-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling (CNMc) is further developed. The overall goal, in very brief terms, is to generate a model, which is able to predict the trajectories of general dynamical systems. The model shall be capable of predicting the trajectories when a model parameter value is changed. Some basics about dynamical systems are covered in subsection ?sec-subsec_1_1_1_Principles and in-depth explanations about CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling are given in chapter ?sec-chap_2_Methodology. \nHowever, for a short and broad introduction to CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling the workflow depicted in figure 1.1 shall be highlighted. The input it receives is data of a dynamical system or space state vectors for a range of model parameter values. The two main important outcomes are some accuracy measurements and the predicted trajectory for each desired model parameter value. Any inexperienced user may only have a look at the predicted trajectories to quickly decide visually whether the prediction matches the trained data. Since CNMccontrol-oriented Cluster-based Network Modeling is written in a modular manner, meaning it can be regarded as a black-box function, it can easily be integrated into other existing codes or workflows. \n\n\n\nFigure 1.1— Broad overview: Workflow of"

However, it turned out that there was no need for it in this web thesis, so it is not used. Nevertheless, after reading their license on Github, I found the content very compelling.\nThus, I want to thank animate.css. Through their project, I came to know about the very appealing Hippocratic License. Let me give you some examples of why this license agreement is awesome: theBDS movement works to raise awareness of and combat the oppression conducted by Israel’s government. They aim to stop international support for Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law. Up until that point, I didn’t know that one could incorporate such beautiful justice into a license agreement, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there has already been significant work done in this area.\nAdditionally, I found great joy in reading some of the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I am deeply grateful to have read such familiar articles and witnessed efforts to spread justice across the globe. When I say familiar articles, I mean, they have reminded me of my Quran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense in short\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are free to use the content of this webpage for whatever you like, including modification, sale, distribution, and more. However, please note that there are some important restrictions: You can do whatever you like with this content as long as it is halal or morally supportable. If you are unsure about a topic, please consult the license agreement.\nFirst, you are not allowed to insult, target minorities or religious groups, support Israel’s government, assist India in its oppression in Kashmir, assist the Chinese government’s oppression against Uighurs, and so on. Second, there is a copyleft - it basically means, your work is mandated to have the same license, i.e., you as well want to make sure that your work cannot be misused."
